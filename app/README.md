# üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite Passes API

Query next passes for a given satellite above you. 

Uses [PyEphem](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem) to predict passes, and [Nasa TLE API](https://github.com/ivanstan/tle-api) to get TLE updated data taken from the greatest [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.com) website.

## API

- `lat` latitude (requeried)

        },
        "end": {
            "alt": 10.0,
            "az": "SE",
            "datetime": "Wed, 06 May 2020 00:36:25 GMT",
            "timestamp": 1588725385
        },
        "visible": false
    }
]
```
The `visible` field actually tells if the satellite will be _probably_ visible, considering the sun is near the horizon, and the observer is at night. You can read more [here](https://www.heavens-above.com/faq.aspx).
