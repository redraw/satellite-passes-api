# Satellite Passes API üõ∞Ô∏è

Query next passes for a given satellite above you. 

Uses [PyEphem](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem) to predict passes, and [Nasa TLE API](https://github.com/ivanstan/tle-api) to get TLE updated data taken from the greatest [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.com) website.

## API

- `lat` latitude
- `lon` longitude

The `visible` field actually tells if the satellite will be _probably_ visible, considering the sun is near the horizon, and the observer is at night. You can read more [here](https://www.heavens-above.com/faq.aspx).
